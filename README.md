# Wireframing

---

## Introduction

**Wireframing** is a foundational step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating low-fidelity visual representations of a website or application layout, outlining structure, content placement, and user interaction flow without focusing on visual styling or branding.

## Why Wireframing Is Important

- **Clarity of Vision**: Helps teams visualise the structure and flow of an interface early in the development process.
- **Efficient Communication**: Provides a common language for designers, developers, stakeholders, and clients to discuss ideas.
- **Iterative Design**: Encourages early feedback, rapid prototyping, and low-cost changes before visual design and development begin.
- **User-Centred Thinking**: Keeps the focus on functionality and user interaction, promoting intuitive and accessible experiences.

## Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes focus on structure over style. They help visualise how users will interact with an interface before graphic design and development begin. Below are the key elements commonly found in a wireframe:

---

### 1️⃣ Layout Structure

This defines the overall skeleton of the page, including margins, columns, grids, and content blocks.

**Example:**  
A homepage wireframe may divide the screen into a header, hero section, three content columns, and a footer, giving developers a blueprint for a responsive layout.

> *Helps maintain consistent visual hierarchy and guides content flow across devices.*

---

### 2️⃣ Navigation

Includes menus, links, sidebars, tabs, or icons that guide users across the interface.

**Example:**  
A navigation bar at the top might include links to “Home,” “Bookings,” “Profile,” and “Support.”

> *Ensures users can easily access key sections, supporting intuitive journeys.*

---

### 3️⃣ Content Placement

Refers to the specific positioning of text, images, buttons, and forms.

**Example:**  
A product listing page may place thumbnails to the left, titles in the centre, and pricing on the right- visually guiding user decision-making.

> *Prioritises content and actions that matter most to the user.*

---

### 4️⃣ Functionality Indicators

These represent interactive elements like buttons, dropdowns, sliders, or input fields- often shown as placeholders or outlined boxes in low-fidelity wireframes.

**Example:**  
A login wireframe may show username and password fields with a “Login” button underneath — even if it’s non-functional at this stage.

> *Shows how users will interact with the interface and where feedback loops occur.*

---

>  Wireframes strip away visual noise to focus purely on usability, functionality, and user flow- they’re where design meets strategy.
