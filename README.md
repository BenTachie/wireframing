# Wireframing

---

## Introduction

**Wireframing** is a foundational step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating low-fidelity visual representations of a website or application layout- outlining structure, content placement, and user interaction flow without focusing on visual styling or branding.

## Why Wireframing Is Important

- **Clarity of Vision**: Helps teams visualize the structure and flow of an interface early in the development process.
- **Efficient Communication**: Provides a common language for designers, developers, stakeholders, and clients to discuss ideas.
- **Iterative Design**: Encourages early feedback, rapid prototyping, and low-cost changes before visual design and development begin.
- **User-Centered Thinking**: Keeps the focus on functionality and user interaction, promoting intuitive and accessible experiences.
